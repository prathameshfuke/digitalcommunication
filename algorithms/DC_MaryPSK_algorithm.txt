M-ARY PSK MODULATION - PROBABILITY OF ERROR ALGORITHM

PURPOSE:
Calculate and plot the probability of error (Pe) for M-ary Phase Shift Keying (M-ary PSK) modulation.

ALGORITHM STEPS:

Input Phase:
1. Accept the energy per bit (Eb) in Joules
2. Accept the power spectral density of noise (No) in microWatts/Hz
3. Accept the number of symbols (M)

Signal-to-Noise Ratio Calculation:
4. Calculate the range of SNR values (Eb/No):
   - Start: 0
   - Step: 0.001
   - End: Eb/No
   - Store in array x

Probability of Error Calculation:
5. Calculate the probability of error for M-ary PSK using the formula:
   - Pe_MaryPSK = erfc(√x × sin(180°/M))
   - Where:
     - erfc is the complementary error function
     - x is the signal-to-noise ratio
     - M is the number of symbols
     - sin(180°/M) is calculated in degrees

Visualization:
6. Create a new figure window
7. Plot Pe_MaryPSK vs SNR (x) with:
   - Line width: 2
   - Grid enabled
8. Label the axes:
   - X-axis: "Signal-to-Noise Ratio (Eb/No)"
   - Y-axis: "Probability of Error Pe"
9. Add legend: "Pe_Marypsk"
10. Add title: "Probability of Error for M-ary PSK"

OUTPUT:
- Graph showing the relationship between SNR and probability of error for M-ary PSK

MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATION:
- M-ary PSK uses M different phases to represent log₂(M) bits per symbol
- Number of bits per symbol: k = log₂(M)
- Phase separation: 2π/M radians or 360°/M degrees
- Probability of error: Pe ≈ erfc(√(Eb/No) × sin(π/M))
- Higher M values require higher SNR for the same error rate
